# Allen-Work-Day-Planner

This week's assignment consisted of taking given starter code of a daily planner and revamping it to have extra features. These extra features included adding a clock displaying the exact date & time at the top of the page, color-coding each hour of the day to represent its past, present or future orientation, and capabilities of saving to local storage. JQuery was utilized as opposed to "vanilla" JavaScript. 

Additional help for this assignment was given by TAs in cirriculum and tutor Juan Delgado.
